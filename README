# Stock Price Forecasting - ARIMA Model

## Model Description

This ARIMA(AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model predicts Apple (AAPL) stock prices with exceptional accuracy.
Training Data: 955 observations (80%)
Test Data: 239 observations (20%)
Test Period: October 2023 - September 2024

**Winner**: ARIMA outperformed LSTM by 66.62%
ARIMA significantly outperformed LSTM because:

Market showed linear trends during test period
Strong short-term autocorrelations
LSTM had insufficient training data (only ~4 years)
Rolling window approach favored ARIMA's adaptability

## Performance Metrics

| Model | RMSE ($) | MAPE (%) | Accuracy (%) |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|
| ARIMA |    2.81  |   1.05   |    98.95     |
| LSTM  |    8.42  |   3.35   |    96.65     |

## Dataset

- **Source**: Yahoo Finance
- **Ticker**: AAPL (Apple Inc.)
- **Period**: January 2020 - September 2024
- **Observations**: 1,194 daily closing prices

## Usage
```python
import pickle
import yfinance as yf

# Download model from this repository
# Load the model
with open('best_arima_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Get recent stock data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2024-01-01', end='2024-10-01')

# Make prediction
forecast = model.forecast(steps=1)

print(f"Next day prediction: ${forecast.values[0]:.2f}")
